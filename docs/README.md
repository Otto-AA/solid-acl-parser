# Solid ACL Parser
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Otto-AA/solid-acl-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Otto-AA/solid-acl-parser)

A js library for working with acl files. It allows you to parse the turtle representation, update permissions and agents, and finally convert it back to turtle. *It does not cover fetching acl files.*

If you don't want to manually fetch and update the acl file, you can take a look at [solid-acl-utils](https://github.com/Otto-AA/solid-acl-utils).


# Status of the project
Everything which seems necessary has been implemented. It is not well tested, but _should work_.
